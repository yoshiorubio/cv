    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      During my Master's and Doctorate, I worked in the development of new quantum-inspired 
      computer vision algorithms for medical imaging. Additionally, I participated in the 
      implementation of deep learnign algorithms for autonomous robots. My current research 
      focuses in quantum-inspired/quantum-enhanced algorithms for optimization and 
      machine learning.
